# Spring Boot Form Example

## Setup

I am using Daniel Alms blaster application as a base

1. Clone repo (In IntelliJ you can select File -> New -> Project from Version Control)
2. Open MYSQL Workbench and create a new schema called __exactly__ `blaster_db`
3. Open application.properties and change `YOUR_PASSWORD` to the MYSQL password you configured when MySQL Workbench was
installed, for example: `1234`
4. Start the application and open http://localhost:8080 in a web browser
